Minecraft Interactive GUI - Yet another bad Minecraft launcher

This project started late 2012 as a quick way for me to copy Minecraft files to and from portable media to play at school. Since then it has evolved into a full Minecraft launcher, attempting to mimic most functionality of Mojang's official Java based launcher, while also adding a few features I find useful (most notably full portability, an encrypted password manager, and support for launching multiple games at once).

This is the third iteration of the launcher, the first being a glorified copy-paste button and the second being a less functional version of the third and current.  
Some features present in the (unreleased) second version (most notably the password manager) are not yet included but are being rewritten and will be added in version 3.1.0.

Jar download for 3.0.1 is
