Minecraft Interactive GUI - Yet another bad Minecraft launcher

This project started late 2012 as a quick way for me to copy Minecraft files to and from portable media to play at school. Since then it has evolved into a full Minecraft launcher, attempting to mimic most functionality of Mojang's official Java based launcher, while also adding a few features I find useful (most notably full portability, an encrypted password manager, and support for launching multiple games at once).
